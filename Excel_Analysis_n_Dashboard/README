SUMMARY: Pinpointed the top 5 factors that accounted for 80% of the downtime and the overall efficiency (64%).

BUSINESS CASE:
Problem: Management noticed a downward trend in productive outputs of operating staff and wanted insights on how to improve line efficiency using productivity and downtime data.
Success metric: Reduce downtime hours and improve overall efficiency significantly.

DATA
Source: Maven Analytics
Tables:
Line productivity - 39 rows, 7 columns (product, batch, operator, start_time, end_time, batch_time)
Products - 7 rows, 4 columns (product_name, flavor, size, min_batch_time)
Downtime factors - 13 rows, 4 columns (factor, description, operator_error, downtime)
Line downtime - 40 rows, 14 columns (batch, operator, downtime_factor)

APPROACH
Analysis: XLookup → custom calculations → pivoting → charts → dashboard.
Tool(s): Excel

MAIN FINDINGS
Overall efficiency was 64%.
The top 5 factors accounted for 80% of the downtime.
3 of the 5 main downtime factors were due to operator.

RECOMMENDATION
Start with machine adjustment training for all operators.
Provide special batch change for Mac (the least efficient operator).
Apply preventive maintenance for machine and double check inventory levels.
