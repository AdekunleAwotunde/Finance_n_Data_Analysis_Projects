Title: MANUFACTURING DOWNTIME ANALYSIS
Summary: Pinpointed the top 5 factors that accounted for 80% of the downtime and the overall efficiency (64%).

Business case
Problem: Management noticed a downward trend in productive outputs of operating staff and wanted insights on how to improve line efficiency using productivity and downtime data.
Success metric: Reduce downtime hours and improve overall efficiency significantly.

Data
Source: Maven Analytics (2019–2024) 
4 tables:
Line productivity - 39 rows, 7 columns (product, batch, operator, start_time, end_time, batch_time)
Products - 7 rows, 4 columns (product_name, flavor, size, min_batch_time)
Downtime factors - 13 rows, 4 columns (factor, description, operator_error, downtime)
Line downtime - 40 rows, 14 columns (batch, operator, downtime_factor)

,  (120k rows, 42 columns (tenure, monthly_charge, support_calls, plan_type, last_login).
Notes: Personally identifiable info removed.

Approach
Pipeline: SQL extraction → pandas cleaning → feature engineering → Random Forest classifier → threshold tuning for recall.
Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP for explainability.

Main findings
Tenure, number of support calls, and last_login_gap were top predictors (see figure).
Targeting top 10% risk group yields expected ROI = $X.

Recommendation
Launch a 3-month retention campaign with offers to top decile.
Add referrer & promotion data to enrich model.
Deploy weekly scoring and alert Product team for sudden distribution shifts.
